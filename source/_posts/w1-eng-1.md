- 1. inability {the fact of not being able to do sth}
    the problem appears to be people's reluctance and inability to travel to see their GP in the extreme weather conditions.
- 2. drill {a way of learning sth by means of repeated exercises}
    another drill that we did was just throw the ball half the glass, or either side, and I try to get it, with somebody holding me back[卡位].
