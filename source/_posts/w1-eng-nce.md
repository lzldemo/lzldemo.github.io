    Last week I went to the theatre, I had a very good seat. The paly was very interesting. I did not enjoy it. A man and a young women sitting behinde me. They were talking loudly. I got very angry. I could not hear the actors. I turned round, I looked at the man and the women angrily. They did not pay any attention{他们毫不理会}. In the end, I could bear it. I turned round again. "I can't hear a word!" I said angrily.

    Postcards always spoil my holidays. Last summer, I went to Italy. I visited Museums and sat in public gardens{公园}. A friendly waiter taught me a few words of Italian. Then he lent me a book. I read a few lines, but I did not understand a word. Every day I thought about postcards. My holidays passed quickly, but I did not send cards to my firends. On the last day{最后一天} I made a bog decision. I got up early and baught 37 cards. I spent the whole day in my room{在房间待了一整天}, but I did not write a single card.
